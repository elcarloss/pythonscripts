hanks for the reply!

I ended up just deleting gnome and gdm. First i changed the mode arch boots into with

systemctl set-default multi-user.target
then i ran

pacman -Rncs gdm gnome
to delete gdm and gnome, i then ran

pacman -S deepin deepin-extra deepin-extras lightdm xorg xorg-utils xorg-xinit
to install those packages then i followed the wiki to set the greeter to lightdm-deepin-greeter.

Which you currently do by editing

/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
and under

[Seat:*]
editing the

greeter-session
variable to

greeter-session=lightdm-deepin-greeter
, make sure you uncomment it because for me it was commented.

And i almost forgot to run:

systemctl set-default graphical.target
