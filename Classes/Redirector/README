Python class to get information from Redirector.
    This python class get information from Redirector of the specified title, 
    on the specified enviroment. It is intended to be a reusable code.

Pre-requisites:
    1.- In order to use this class it is necessary that you import the 
        directory where is the class. Ex:
        sys.path.insert(0, '$HOME/p4/gosops/tools/gos24x7/toolbox/')

Functions:
    This script has several functions to get specific data. All of them takes 
    as argument the title of the game.

    --> get_server_info: This function returns an elementtree object parsing 
                         the redirector response from rediector/getServerList.
    --> get_server_cluster_info: This function return an elementtree object
                                 parsing the redirector response from:
                                 rediector/getServerList2.
    --> get_server_host_map: This function returns two dictionaries with the 
                             current map look of the blaze instances, one map 
                             is for master instances and other map is for 
                             slaves instances.
    --> get_blazeversion: This function returns a list with the blaze version 
                          and the current CL.
    --> get_branch: This function return the perforce branch of the game.
    --> get_currentwd: This function return current working directory of title.
    --> get_instances_map: This function returns two dictionaries, one is the 
                           map of all master instances with servers, and the 
                           second one have the slaves instances.
Usage:
    First we have to initialize a class object with the enviroment, then 
    all the functions must be called with the title as argument. Ex:

        >> sys.path.insert(0, '$HOME/p4/gosops/tools/gos24x7/toolbox/')
        >> from redirclass import RedirectorUtil
        >> redirector = RedirectorUtil(env)
        >> titlesredir.get_instances_map(title)
